## Description

Smart Scalper PRO MT5 is a trading robot that utilizes a simple moving average (SMA) indicator to identify potential trading opportunities in the market. It opens long positions when the current bid price is above the SMA and opens short positions when the current bid price is below the SMA.

The program includes necessary libraries and defines constants for lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels. It uses the Trade class provided by MQL5 to execute trades and manage positions.

## How it Works

1. The program initializes by setting the initial stop loss and take profit levels.
2. It enables real-time events by setting a timer.
3. On each tick event, the program gets the current bid and ask prices and calculates the SMA.
4. If the bid price is above the SMA, a long position is opened with the specified lot size, ask price, stop loss level, and take profit level.
5. If the bid price is below the SMA, a short position is opened with the specified lot size, bid price, stop loss level, and take profit level.
6. On deinitialization, the program closes all open positions.
7. On each timer event, the program checks if trading is allowed. If not, it closes all open positions.
8. The program continues to execute the OnStart event handler.
